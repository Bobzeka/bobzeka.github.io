          <p>This project was my semester-long project for my Objects and Design class (CS 2340) at Georgia Tech. I worked in a team of five to implement a set of guideline features based on weekly deadlines using the Agile development framework. The project allowed for a wide-range of implementations and UI/UX design philosophies and provided extra credit for any additional work or exceptional implementation.</p>
          <p>Skills Used: Android, Java, XML, Git</p>

          <h1>Untitled Ongoing Research Project</h1>
          <p>I modified the <a rev="nofollow" href="https://github.com/Bobzeka/Bluez-5.40/blob/master/attrib">uncommented Bluez Bluetooth library for Linux</a> as part of an ongoing research project in the Alternative Computing Technologies Lab under <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hadi/">Dr. Hadi Esmaeilzadeh</a>. The Bluez library was used to connect with an Arduino-based robot through Bluetooh Low Energy 4.1 to send it commands and receive a code back as a form of error checking. After completing the Bluetooth portion of the project over the summer, I have continued to work on other portions of the porject with the team of undergraduate and graduate students developing the larger project.</p>
          <p>Skills Used: C, C++</p>

          <h1>Usage Logger</h1>
          <p>This project was started by Dilan Manatunga in 2014 as part of the <a href="http://comparch.gatech.edu/hparch/">High Performance Architecture Lab</a> at Georgia Tech. The project was further developed by another undergraduate student afterwards. I took the outdated code and brought it up to date so it runs on the latest versions of Android. I removed some outdated features like sync, and I added new features such as dumping logs to an external file and selecting apps to be anonymized.</p>

          <p>This project was my final project for my Data Structures and Algorithms class (CS 1332) at Georgia Tech. This was an individual project with the goal of implementing a complex data structure of my own choosing. The project was comprised of selecting a structure, researching the structure to reach a level of understanding, designing your own implementation based on this understanding, fully implementing the design, and testing the design until all edge cases were sufficiently covered.</p>
          <p>Skills Used: Java, JUnit</p>
